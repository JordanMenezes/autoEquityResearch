# Welcome to Automated Equity Investment Research

Welcome to this *work-in-progress* tool designed to assist analysts in automating equity investment research for stocks of choice and discovering potential investment opportunities.

## What Does This Tool Do?

This tool automates the process of gathering both technical and fundamental information. By default, it covers companies listed on the Saudi stock exchange. You can customize the selection by adding your preferred stock tickers; refer to the `How to Select Companies` section for guidance.

## How to Use?

1. Open link to Google Colab to run in your browser, click [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1E8paFFe68bPWe8vEcwcbUxjhMj5N45ej?usp=sharing).

2. Press CTRL+F9 to execute the script. Wait until it finishes running, and an Excel file named `colab_stock_data.xlsx` is saved in your Downloads folder.

Note: You may also run this on your mobile devices. However, you will need a spreadsheet/Excel app.

## How to Select Companies?

Navigate to the `Select Your Companies` section in Google Colab and modify the list of stock tickers. You can find ticker names on https://finance.yahoo.com/ for use in this script.
